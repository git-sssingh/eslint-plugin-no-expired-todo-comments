# eslint-plugin-no-expired-todo-comments

ðŸŽ‰ An ESLint plugin that prevents TODO comments with expired dates! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

The eslint-plugin-no-expired-todo-comments is an ESLint plugin that provides a new rule for detecting TODO comments with expired dates. This plugin ensures that you don't have any outdated TODO comments in your codebase, helping you keep your code clean and organized.

Inspired by [@parker_codes](https://twitter.com/parker_codes)'s [parker-codes/todo-by](https://github.com/parker-codes/todo_by), check it out!

## Installation

You can install the eslint-plugin-no-expired-todo-comments plugin using npm:

```sh
npm install eslint-plugin-no-expired-todo-comments --save-dev
# or
yarn add eslint-plugin-no-expired-todo-comments --dev
# or
pnpm add eslint-plugin-no-expired-todo-comments --save-dev
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the `no-expired-todo-comments` rule in your ESLint configuration:

```javascript
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ["no-expired-todo-comments"],
  rules: {
    "no-expired-todo-comments/no-expired-todo-comments": "error",
  },
};
```

Now, whenever you have a TODO comment with an expired date in your codebase, ESLint will raise an error:

```javascript
// This will raise an error
// TODO: 2020-01-01: This is an expired TODO comment
```

As simple as that!
